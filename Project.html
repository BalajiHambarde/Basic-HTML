        <center><p>K.G.F is an Indian Kannada-language period gangster film series set mostly in the Kolar Gold Fields, which gives the series its name, created by Prashanth Neel and produced by Hombale Films starring Yash in lead role with an ensemble supporting cast.[4] Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the series follows two narrators, Anand Ingalangi and his son Vijayendra Ingalangi, who gives an interview of a book written by Anand to a leading news channel, which tells the life story of Raja Krishnappa Bairya alias Rocky (Yash), a Mumbai-based high ranking mercenary born in poverty and how he became the most dreaded person at that time.
        Filming for K.G.F: Chapter 2 started on 13 March 2019 in Hyderabad, with a formal puja ceremony.[43][44] After an initial round of filming near Bangalore in May 2019,[45] Yash announced that he will join the sets only in June 2019.[46] The shoot at Cyanide Hills in Kolar Gold Fields was interrupted by a complaint from N Srinivas, president of the KGF's National Citizens Party who filed a petition against the makers and alleged that the film is being shot in a cyanide grounds area [47] In September 2019, the makers started shooting for the second schedule in Hyderabad where Sanjay Dutt joined the sets of the film in Hyderabad.[48][49][50][51] After a court stay order on 27 September, the makers returned to shoot the film at Kolar.[52][53] In October 2019, the makers returned to Karnataka, after filming the extensive schedule in Hyderabad.[54]
